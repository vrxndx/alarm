### Project Description
"WakeUp Math" is an interactive alarm clock that challenges users with a simple math problem to solve before the alarm can be dismissed. This engaging approach helps users wake up more alert and mentally prepared for the day.

### The Problem statement
"WakeUp Math" is designed to prove to your brain that it's not actually in charge. It's a cunning scheme to force your sleepy neurons to do a little mental gymnastics before they're allowed to enjoy the sweet embrace of consciousness.

Think of it as a tiny, math-based rebellion against the tyranny of the snooze button.

Essentially, it's a hilarious and slightly sadistic way to ensure you're awake enough to remember where you put your keys.

Disclaimer: May cause unintended mental arithmetic skills to develop.

### The Solution
The Problem: You're jolted awake by an unholy blend of beeping and a math problem staring back at you. Your brain, still half-asleep, tries to decipher the symbols as if they were hieroglyphics.

The Struggle: Panic sets in. You frantically search for a calculator (which, of course, is nowhere to be found). You try to recall the multiplication tables, but they seem to have vanished into the ether.

The Guessing Game: You resort to wild guesses, hoping against hope that sheer luck will prevail.

The Triumph (or Defeat): Finally, you either stumble upon the correct answer, feeling a surge of unexpected triumph, or you surrender and hit the snooze button, vowing to conquer the mathematical menace another day.

Pro Tip: If all else fails, try bargaining with the alarm clock. Offer it a piece of your breakfast in exchange for mercy. It might just work (probably not).

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [HTML, CSS, JavaScript ]
- [None]
- [None]
- [ Visual Studio Code (or preferred IDE)]

For Hardware:
Hardware Specifications

Processor: Any modern processor (Intel Core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3 or equivalent) will suffice.
RAM: 2GB of RAM should be enough, but 4GB is recommended for smoother performance.
Storage: A small amount of storage space is needed (a few hundred megabytes).
Display: Any monitor or screen will work.
Sound Card (Optional): Required if you want to use an alarm sound.
Speakers or Headphones (Optional): Required if you want to hear the alarm sound.
Software Specifications

Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux will work.
Web Browser: Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) is required to run the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
Other Considerations

Audio File: If you want to use a custom alarm sound, you'll need an audio file in a compatible format (MP3, WAV, etc.).
These are minimum requirements. A more powerful system will provide a smoother and more responsive experience.

Note: This is for a simple web-based application. If you were to build a more complex alarm clock with additional features, the requirements might increase.

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
1.Clone the repository: https://github.com/vrxndx/alarm.git
